Insights Summary
(MSE 302 – Arham Khan, October 2025)
1. Accessibility and Timeliness
• Counselling delays of four to six weeks significantly limit student access to support (HEQCO, 2024).
• AI-based tools can provide immediate interaction, guided reflection, and coping strategies between counselling sessions.
• This immediacy addresses the gap between high demand for help and limited institutional capacity.
2. Effectiveness of Existing AI Tools
• Woebot and Wysa have demonstrated measurable reductions in mild depression and anxiety symptoms in controlled trials (Fitzpatrick, 2017).
• However, these systems lack personalization for university-specific challenges such as exam stress, academic pressure, and financial anxiety (Inkster & Montague, 2022).
• Students report that while chatbots are accessible, they often feel emotionally shallow or generic, highlighting the need for context-aware design.
3. Ethical and Design Challenges
• Research identifies privacy risks, over-trust in AI systems, and limited regulation in mental-health chatbots (Maier, 2023; Dodson, 2025).
• Chatbots have produced unsafe or inaccurate advice in crisis situations, demonstrating the need for embedded escalation protocols (AP News, 2023).
• Ethical design must include clear disclaimers, transparent data handling, and defined boundaries between digital wellness support and clinical care.
4. Key Opportunity
• No current AI system is trained specifically on the student experience or designed to integrate with campus mental-health infrastructure.
• A context-aware AI life coach could fill this gap by combining empathy-simulated conversation with structured, evidence-based coaching exercises and transparent ethical safeguards.
• Such a tool would bridge the divide between self-help resources and professional therapy while maintaining responsible oversight.
5. Impact on Project Direction
• These findings guided the project’s reframing from “AI for therapy” to “AI for life coaching,” emphasizing ethical complementarity rather than replacement.
• Insights informed the development of the system map and competitor comparison table included in this repository.
• The synthesis supports a Management Engineering approach—using systems thinking and data-driven design to enhance student well-being through responsible technology.
