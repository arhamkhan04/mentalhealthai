1. Research Objectives

The goal of this research is to build a clear contextual understanding of how AI can ethically support the mental health of university students. Specifically, this research aims to:
• Identify the scale and causes of mental-health challenges among Canadian post-secondary students.
• Assess existing digital mental-health solutions (for example, Wysa, Woebot, ChatGPT).
• Examine ethical, regulatory, and design limitations of current AI approaches.
• Synthesize opportunities for improvement focused on student life coaching rather than therapy.

2. Information Needs

To address these objectives, three categories of information were defined:

Category	Description	Expected Outcome
Student Mental Health Trends	Quantitative and qualitative data on student stress, anxiety, and access to care	Context for defining scope and user pain points
AI Mental Health Tools	Evidence and performance of chatbot-based and AI-driven support systems	Benchmarking of current capabilities and limitations
Ethics and Design Gaps	Literature on ethical risks, trust, bias, and data safety in AI	Framework for ensuring responsible design principles
3. Search Strategy

Databases and repositories: PubMed, Google Scholar, BMC, Frontiers, JMIR, HEQCO, Universities Canada.
Keywords: “university student mental health Canada,” “AI chatbots therapy,” “ethical AI mental health,” “Woebot Wysa effectiveness,” “AI life coach for students.”
Selection criteria: published 2017 or later, peer-reviewed or institutional credibility, relevant to post-secondary settings, and directly connected to AI or counselling innovation.

4. Process Summary

Initial scan: identified more than 25 documents across academic and policy databases.

Filtering: evaluated each for relevance, credibility, and geographic or demographic focus.

Final selection: 10 core sources divided into background, AI tools, and ethics categories.

Organization: sources saved in structured folders, summarized in spreadsheets, and linked to the executive summary.

5. Validation and Documentation

Each selected source was cross-checked for publication reliability and factual accuracy.
Summaries and key insights are recorded in “research/source_summary_table.xlsx.”
All citations are formatted in APA 7 style in “references/reference_list_APA.md.”
Raw PDFs are stored in “research/source_pdfs/” for transparency.

6. Connection to Design Process

Findings from this research informed:
• The “Problem Overview” section (statistical data and causal factors).
• The “Existing Solutions and Gaps” table (comparative analysis of AI tools).
• The “Problem Scoping and Future Directions” section (ethical and contextual framing).

This systematic approach demonstrates evidence-based information gathering and analysis, fulfilling MSE 302 Milestone 3 requirements for rigor, transparency, and traceability.
