## üìö Research Overview
This project investigates how AI life-coaching systems can bridge gaps in university mental-health support.  
Research combined secondary sources (academic & institutional reports) with structured GenAI-assisted synthesis.

Key phases:
1. Define information needs  
2. Collect and evaluate 10 credible sources  
3. Extract insights and create visual analysis  
4. Use GenAI tools iteratively and responsibly  

All sources, prompts, and analytical outputs are documented with transparent citations and hyperlinks.
