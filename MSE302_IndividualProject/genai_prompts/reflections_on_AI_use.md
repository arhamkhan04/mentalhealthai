Purpose
This log documents how generative AI tools (ChatGPT, Google Gemini, etc.) were used to support information gathering, synthesis, and writing for the project “AI Life Coaching for University Students.”
Use of AI was focused on extending analysis, structuring content, and validating ideas — not replacing human reasoning or research effort.

| Stage | GenAI Use | Example Prompt | Student Evaluation / Reflection |
|--------|------------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| Information Gathering | Used to identify recent academic sources and summarize key findings from databases such as PubMed and HEQCO. | “Find peer-reviewed studies evaluating mental-health chatbots (2017–2024).” | Helped locate credible studies faster; all sources were verified manually for accuracy. |
| Synthesis & Comparison | Used to format research insights into structured comparison tables and extract key quantitative data (trial sizes, satisfaction rates). | “Summarize key metrics for Woebot and Wysa clinical studies.” | Efficient for initial draft; final numbers cross-checked with original publications. |
| Writing Assistance | Used to improve flow and clarity of report paragraphs while maintaining original analytical content. | “Refine paragraph for clarity without changing meaning.” | AI improved structure, but final language reviewed and edited for accuracy. |
| Visualization Planning | Used to brainstorm layout ideas for system map and flow diagram. | “What should be included in a system map for AI-assisted mental-health systems?” | Generated initial ideas; visuals created manually in Figma. |
